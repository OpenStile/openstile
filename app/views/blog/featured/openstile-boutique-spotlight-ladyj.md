**You have a long history with the neighborhood - from studying at Pratt Art Institute to supporting community pillars such as The Co-Op School of Brooklyn....What makes Brooklyn unique and why is it special to you? **
Ohhh so many things. I moved here in 1995 and never left after attending Pratt. It's an ever-changing city with lots of rich cultural stimuli. Just walking down the street you can see amazing independent art, or this local man who always wears purple velvet suits with matching fedoras, or maybe I'll stop and admire a hand-written font on the window of a corner deli, then drink some java from my favorite local coffee shop under a cherry blossom tree that is blooming with feather-like petals, gaze at a sunrise streaming down Bergen Street, reflecting on an angular architectural marvel - and thats just on my way to work!
For me, Brooklyn never has a dull moment or dearth of interesting sights, all of which are inspiring.

**Who is the Lady J +1 woman, and what does her style encompass?**
A woman looking for unique finds! It's someone who is not looking to homogenize - but rather find a few pieces of jewelry or clothing that are versatile and stand out.

<br/><br/>


**What is one of your favorite Lady J Jewelry Designs pieces and why was creating it particularly special for you?**
I especially enjoy setting one-of-a-kind stones; that certainly makes for a favorite creation. So, definitely when I made the Noconi necklace for the Comanche Collection - that had a baby trilobite fossil set into the necklace with two hammered silver snakes connecting it.

<br/><br/>


**When it comes to giving your clients that personal touch, what are some specials ways you attend to client needs?**
Because my shop is also my studio, which makes it very intimate, I find that customers and clients will spend an indefinite amount of time trying on clothing & jewelry, talking about the neighborhood, and sometimes even enjoying a cup of tea with me! We really offer a warm and relaxing environment for shopping, and with honest styling advice. Most of our customers often pop-back in just to say hi!
