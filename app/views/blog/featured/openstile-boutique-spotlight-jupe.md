**Shayna, you are originally from Columbus, Ohio. How did you make your way from the Midwest to the East Coast?**<br />
I moved to NYC in 2005 when I was 16 years old to attend an all girls high school. I have a lot of family here and I was always drawn to the 
world's fashion capital!<br/><br/>

**Did you always have fashion aspirations?**<br /> 
I’ve always loved fashion since I was a little girl and I think I’ll always be drawn to some of those amazing 90’s styles like 
prints, sequins, bright colors, and the drop waist!<br/><br/>

**Jupe offers a chance for style mavens to book an appointment to take a look at your showroom. 
Is this something that you have always offered, and why was it important to you introduce such a thoughtful feature like that into the Jupe brand?**<br/>
I believe most customers appreciate a shopping experience where they can feel comfortable and where the boutique owner really understands them and what their needs. 
Finding an outfit that fully fits the customer's body type and style is one of the most rewarding things for me.<br/><br/> 


**Fast fashion is a thing now, and sometimes people can get really caught up in buying into what everyone else is doing. 
How do you manage to bring such an eclectic mix to your store and create your own lane?**<br/>
At Jupe, we tend to stay true to our aesthetic while sprinkling in some of the latest trends. We feel it is a great way to introduce our 
customers into certain styles that they might not be comfortable to wear originally and we show them how they can make it work.<br/><br/>
