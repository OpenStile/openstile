OpenStile is gearing up for a Brooklyn launch, and we couldn’t be more excited! OpenStile is a fashion-tech service that connects shoppers with awesome neighborhood boutiques for personal styling sessions. 
We launch on Small Business Saturday (Nov 28) and look forward to bringing you hand-picked style from your favorite retailers.

So how does it work? Simple! First create a personalized style profile to capture things like your budget, sizes, body type and more. 
Then book FREE styling sessions with our partner boutiques. They’ll know when you’re coming in, what you like and don’t like, and what you’re actively seeking. 
Powered by this knowledge, our boutique owners will hand-pick outfits you’re sure to love!<br/><br/>
