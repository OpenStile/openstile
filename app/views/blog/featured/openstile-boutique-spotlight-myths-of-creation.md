OpenStile launches in Brooklyn this Small Business Saturday (Nov 28) and we couldn't be more excited about our squad of
local boutiques. For this Boutique Spotlight we chat with Xenia Viray, owner of [Myths of Creation](http://mythsofcreation.com). 
See what she has to say about her unique store aesthetic, her designer selection process, and what's on deck for 2016!

**Myths of Creation’s store aesthetic is very unique, like the name. How did you decide on the name?**<br/>

The name Myths of Creation comes from the general observation that in fashion so much of what we know about a company or icon is 
mythical or essentially false. At the same time, that false story has meaning, affects culture and inspires meaning. 
I asked myself the question of what compels someone to want a $10,000 handbag. What do these fashion objects symbolize for the wearer.<br/> 

From working in fashion I got to see behind the veil of these intimidating high-end entities. 
The name Myths of Creation acknowledges  that we are the creators of our own stories and myths and that we have the 
freedom to be playful, and that even our fictions have truths in them.<br/> 

I am interested in the reality and the myth behind everything: how products and are made, pop icons, and artists. 
I am especially inspired by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell who says, “The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.” 
I studied fiction in college and I think storytelling is relevant in fashion and business and in creating your own image or 
finding meaning in your life.<br/><br/>


**You are one of the few boutiques who actually states that they are open later. 
Why do you feel it is important to offer that to your shoppers? Is this a way to know your customer base better?**<br/>

We are open later on the weekends because we are such a neighborhood spot. 
This place is full of amazing service industry workers, freelancers, artists and students. 
They don’t have time to go shopping during normal business hours because they are always working. 
We think of ourselves as part of a small neighborhood ecology and it just serves us to stay open a little later. 
Plus, we always have something to do!<br/><br/>

**What process do you go through as a boutique owner to add new designers and select new pieces?**<br/>

We really listen to our customers to guide our buying.  I come from the editorial side of fashion: I was a fashion writer, 
and a stylists and photo assistant. I was also a buyer for a shoe store on the Upper West Side. 
What I learned is that what editors choose and what buyers choose are completely different. 
Editors want what reads as interesting in a magazine on a model. Fashion on the ground level changes very slowly. 
People will buy the same style for years and years because it's sensible. Our job is to keep our eye out for things that 
have wearability and an element of surprise, so it’s a little intuition with a lot of practical observation.<br/><br/> 


**Clearly owning a boutique is a passion of yours. What should shoppers lookout for from Myths of Creation in the next year?**<br/>

Our store has already grown so much in a year. We used to have two styles of shoes and one style of bag and now we have so 
much we can barely fit our clothes on the racks! In the next year we hope to create an awesome print zine, 
have regular content online and an Instagram where we post something new for sale every single day. 
This way we can keep customer’s cards on file and they can buy things just by commenting on Instagram. 
And as always, we will always be developing our own basics, and new awesome reusable shopping bags for our customers that 
spend over $100. (This year they were inspired by vintage Pan-Am bags!)<br/><br/>
