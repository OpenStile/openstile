**Luxurious Faux-Fur Collars**

We’re seeing faux fur pop up on the hoods of jackets & along the lapels of our favorite pea coats. With a statement piece like this, feel free to keep the rest of your outfit casual & simple.
<br/><br/>
**Cozy Plaid Scarves**

Plaid is the ultimate fall print—from shirts to skirts to pants. Fashion expert Joanna Doe says:<br/> 
> Try a plaid scarf to instantly update any outfit, like in a blanket shape for a more dramatic effect or a simple infinity scarf for easy application.

**Wide-Leg Denim**

Ready for a break from skinnies & bootcut? Fall 2015 marks the return of the wide-leg jean (hurray!). You’ll love this trend for its ability to make your legs look insanely long. If you’re petite, make sure to wear wedges or higher shoes—these tend to run long.
<br/><br/>
**Cognac Accessories**

It’s time to trade in your go-to black handbag for something that screams “fall.” Rich, warm and still a neutral, the color cognac goes with anything! And, don’t forget, it’s ok to mismatch your accessories with your shoes.
<br/><br/>
**Moody Florals**

If spring is all about bright, perky florals, then their fall counterpart is deep-hued & moody. This richer, more grown-up floral print can be worn to work or special events to exude a romantic vibe without being too feminine.
<br/><br/>
**Cable-Knit Sweaters**

Oh-so-cozy & classic, the cable-knit sweater is a wardrobe staple that never goes out of style. This chunkier knit—especially in a neutral fall color like beige or mustard—is ideal for throwing on with jeans when days turn cold.

**Detailed Leggings**

As we’ve said before, leggings aren’t just for lazy Sundays or trips to the gym. If you want comfy and polished, try fall’s detailed leggings with zippers or faux-leather accents. Then, simply pair them back to a long sweater and booties. Remember these leggings tips:
<br/><br/>

1. Buy a flattering size
2. Avoid busy patterns or bright colors
3. Make sure it's quality fabric to avoid ugly runs

**Windowpane Prints**

More minimal than plaid—but with the same cold-weather feel—windowpane prints are the dressed-up cousin to your fall flannel. Ask your Stylist for this print in flirty skirts and blouses to pair with denim or a work blazer.
<br/><br/>
**Statement Suede**

Suede might be one of the most versatile trends swinging in for fall. This ’70s-inspired fabric (in real or faux) is 100% bohemian luxe and can flip a simple outfit into a retro dream. Take suede for a whirl with a simple handbag, or opt for more impact with jackets & skirts.
<br/><br/>
**Bright Mustard**

One of our favorite fall colors, mustard yellow, exudes the richness of fall while still maintaining a cheery presence. An important addition to your wardrobe for adding pops of unexpected color, mustard instantly injects liveliness to your look.
