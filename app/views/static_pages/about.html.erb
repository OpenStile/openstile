          <p>At OpenStile, it's more than a passion for fashion. We know three things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1) Powerful things happen when women look and feel their best.</li>
            <li>2) Every woman has a style of her own that makes her stand out from the crowd.</li>
            <li>3) The unique pieces that enhance our personal style can be found at local fashion retailers.</li>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>

        <p>
          Tamara Austin and her friends wanted a better way to explore local fashion in Washington D.C. 
          In a city that's all business, they didn't want to be just another person in a working professional uniform. 
          They wanted to escape the mass-produced items. Each having her own style, body type, and budget, they wanted 
          a shopping experience that took all of that into account and catered to them as individuals.<br /><br />

          She began meeting with boutique owners to discuss these challenges and discovered a whole community of 
          local fashion retailers who wanted more exposure with shoppers. 
          It stretched far beyond the handful of brick-and-mortar locations to include pop-up stores and the growing fashion truck scene. 
          All of these homegrown retailers had a unique story and brand. 
          Most importantly they carried the pieces Tamara and her friends craved, and shared their vision for a more personal way to shop.<br /><br />

          Tamara, who studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia and worked as an IT professional, 
          started OpenStile as a way to connect local shoppers with neighborhood fashion retailers.
