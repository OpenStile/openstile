          <h3>What We Believe</h3>
          <p>At OpenStile, it's more than a passion for fashion. We know three things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Powerful things happen when women look and feel their best.</li>
            <li>Every woman has a style of her own that makes her stand out from the crowd.</li>
            <li>The beautiful, unique pieces that enhance our personal style can be found at all the really cool fashion boutiques in our neighborhoods.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Tamara and her friends wanted a better way to explore local fashion in Washington D.C. 
          They wanted to escape the mass-produced items, and in a city that's all business, 
          they didn't want to be just another drone in a working professional uniform. 
          Each having their own style, body type, and budget, they wanted a shopping experience that 
          took all of that into account and catered to them as an individual.<br /><br />

          She began meeting with boutique owners to discuss these challenges and discovered a whole 
          community of local fashion retailers who wanted more exposure with shoppers. 
          It stretched far beyond the handful of brick-and-mortar locations to include pop-up stores 
          and the growing fashion truck scene. All of these homegrown retailers had their own unique story 
          and lifestyle brand. Most importantly, they carried the pieces Tamara and her friends craved 
          and shared their vision for a personalized, more intimate way to shop.<br /><br />

          Tamara, who studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia and worked as an IT professional, 
          started OpenStile as a way to connect local shoppers with neighborhood fashion retailers.
