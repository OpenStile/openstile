    <h3>At OpenStile we know the following to be true:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Powerful things happen when women look and feel their best</li>
      <li>Every woman has a style of her own that makes her stand out from the crowd</li>
      <li>A more personal, individualized way to shop is the key women leaving stores looking and feeling their best</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>These truths inspired us to start OpenStile, and we look forward to continued growth for the service!</h3>

        <h3>
          Tamara wanted a better way to shop for clothes. She hated going store to store only to leave either
          empty-handed or regretful. She wanted to find those one-of-a-kind pieces that allowed her to confidently
          stand out from the crowd. This was a frustration she shared with several friends who all had different styles,
          body types, and budgets.<br /><br />
          Tamara comes from a background in tech. After graduating from the University of Virginia with a degree in Computer Science,
          she worked as a software engineer and IT consultant in the Washington DC area. She started OpenStile as a way
          to directly apply her technical expertise to her entrepreneurial passions.

          Sparkle's love for fashion started when she worked in retail. She loved helping clients put together stylish outfits,
          and continued doing so for friends even after leaving retail to pursue another career. She witnessed first hand
          how hard it was for friends and clients to style themselves, and thought to herselfâ€¦ if only stores would provide a
          personal stylist to clients.<br /><br />
          Sparkle, a lifelong native of Brooklyn, knew the value of launching the OpenStile service in such a diverse landscape
          with so many different boutiques that cater to different styles. She brings to OpenStile her passion for fashion
          along with a broad range of experience in different fields of work such as healthcare technology and graphic design.
